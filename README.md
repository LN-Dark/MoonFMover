# Moon ‡•ê File Mover
Simple copy or move directory to any storage. Android


The initial idea was to transfer the DCIM folder to external storage.

You can save the locations and just open the app and click copy to transfer the folder to the saved location.

I am also using it to move Telegram X downloads to the Downloads folder.
